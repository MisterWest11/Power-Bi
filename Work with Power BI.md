# Getting started building with Power BI

The building blocks of Power BI are  semantic models and visualizations. Create a semantic model and then use visuals to build a report.

**Create a semantic model**

a semantic model consists of all connected data, transformations, relationships and calculations.

To follow the flow of Power BI, you first connect to data, transform data, and create relationships and calculations to create a semantic model.

first, connect to as many data sources you need. Then clean and transform the data to your needs. Add relationships between tables and calculations to extend the semantic model..

**Create visualizationss in a report**

Power BI is a low-code solution, which means you drag-drop data field. It will choose a visual for your data field.
