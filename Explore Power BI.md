# What can I do with Power BI service as a consumer.

Problem: You receive data from various sources (reports, emails, spreadsheets) making it difficult to find and manage.

Solution: Power BI transforms data into charts and graphs for easier visualization.

Benefits:

Clearer Insights: View data trends and gain insights from compelling visuals instead of raw tables.

Collaboration: Work with colleagues on the same up-to-date reports and dashboards from any device.

Automatic Updates: Always work with the latest data thanks to automatic refresh.

Advanced Analysis: Explore data further, find trends and ask questions using natural language.

Alerts: Set thresholds and receive notifications when data reaches specific values.

Accessibility: Access data anytime, anywhere (cloud or on-premise) from any device.

The way you interact with Power BI depends on your job role. As a user or consumer, you are the person who receives dashboards, reports and app from designers who create them.  You dont need to be a scientist to perform complex data analysis. 

**Safely interact with content**

You can interact with your content. Filter, slice, subscribe and export content without affecting the underlying dataset or original dashboards, reports or app.



**Dashboards**

A Power BI dashboard is made up of tiles that, together, tell a story. Because its limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the most important elements of that story.

You cannot edit the dashboard, but there are several ways to use the data to monitor your business and make data-backed decisions.

Tiles on a dashboard are more than just pictures, hover over a tile to view details about the data behind the visual.

# Collaborate and share in Power BI

Key Points:

Designers Sharing Content:

Designers can share individual dashboards/reports via links or installing them in your workspace.

They can also share a collection of content as a single Power BI app.

All shared content appears under "Shared with me" or "Apps" in the navigation pane.

Consumers Sharing Content (with Reshare Permissions):

If a designer grants reshare permissions, you can share the content with others from "My Workspace."

External colleagues cannot reshare content, even if allowed by the designer.

You can also share dashboards/reports from the Power BI mobile apps.

Adding Comments to Dashboards:

Anyone with access to a shared dashboard can add comments directly on the visuals or the entire dashboard.

You can use the "@" symbol to mention specific colleagues in your comments.

Printing Power BI Reports and Dashboards:

You can print entire dashboards, reports (page by page or exported to PDF), or individual tiles/visuals.

The printing process depends on your web browser.

Exporting Reports to PowerPoint:

You can export a report as a PowerPoint presentation with each report page as a slide linked to the live report.

Choose between embedding an image (current values) or live data (original report).
