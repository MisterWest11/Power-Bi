# Report Structure

A report has at least one report page, however it can ever multiple pages. On each page, report objects are laid out. Report objects include:

  * Visuals - Visualizations of semantic model data.

  * Elements - Provide visual interest. Elements include text boxes, buttons and images.

# Report Pages

Power BI report pages function similarly to Excel. There are two ways for report consumers to navigate between pages: selecting a page tab or selecting a page from the Pages pane.

The number of pages in a report depend on how you want to present the data. A well-designed report typically has a summary on the first page with more details on subsequent pages.

# Design The analytical report layout

The report design should follow principles to effectively communicate data:

  * Placement - put the most important information at the top-corner and arrange elements from left to right and top bottom. Align objects and consider the rule of thirds for positioning.

  * Balance - distribute weight evenly accorss the page to create stability and structure.

  * Proximity - Group related objects together and use space to visually separate them.

  * Contrast - Use contrasting colors, fonts, or lines to emphasize important objects and direct attention.

  * Repetition - Use consistent design elements for related objects to create association and strengthen layout.

# Design visually appealing reports

 * Space - Use margins and spacing between objects to avoid clutter and improve readability.

 * Size - Set an appropriate page size and size visual based on importance.

 * Alignment - Align visuals and sections for a balanced and organized look.

 * Color - Use a limited color palette with soft base colours and bolder colours for highlighting exceptions.

 * Consistency - Maintain a consistent formatting throughout the report using a report theme.
