# GET DATA FROM FILES

This document describes how to import data from Excel files into Power BI Desktop. There are three main options for where to store your Excel file: locally on your computer, on OneDrive (business or personal), or on SharePoint Team Sites. The best option depends on whether you want your data and Power BI reports to stay synchronized. Once you've chosen a location, you can follow these steps to import the data:

In Power BI, click "Get data" and select "Excel".

Find and open your Excel file.

In the Navigator window, select the tables you want to import.

Click "Load" to import the data directly or "Transform Data" to clean the data first.
